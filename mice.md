# Resources
* [Eloshapes](https://www.eloshapes.com/)
  - Nice website to look into different mice specifications.
  - Not every mice is in the database.
  - Not the best to rely on as some shapes will look very similar to each other but in reality they are possibly different.
 * [Rting](https://www.rtings.com/mouse)
   - Website that reviews and provide performance data for mice.
   - Certain categories such as their mouse reviews limit you to 10 reviews a day.
   - Not every mice is in their database.
   - Unlike Eloshapes, uses 3D scans instead of 2D outlines.
 * [TechPowerUp](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/?category=Mice&manufacturer=&pp=25&order=date)
   - Also reviews and provide performance data for mice.
   - Not every mice if in their database.
   - No comparison tool for mice shapes.

* Maya 8k<sup>1</sup> 
* Thorn<sup>1, 2</sup>

### Logitech<sup>1</sup>
* G102 (International Model) / G203 (US Model) <sup>2</sup>
* G304 (International Model) / G305 (US Model) <sup>2</sup>
* G Pro X Superlight <sup>3, 4</sup>
* G Pro X Superlight 2 <sup>3, 4</sup>

###### Notes
###### <sup>1</sup> ** BUY WITH CAUTION! QUALITY CONTROL (QC) ISSUE**. Older models are very prone to double clicking due to the use bad switches.Hard to recommend any of their models but they are perfectly fine if options are super limited. 
###### <sup>2</sup> For those who are in a budget and have very limited options due to their local market.
###### <sup>3</sup> Recommend getting the Maya X or Viper V3 Pro if it's available in your market. The shape is very similar but it is built much better. 
###### <sup>4</sup> Not recommended to buy new. Can be bought used for cheap. Units with double clicking can be easily fixed by either soldering new switches or buying a hotswap PCB off aliexpress. G Pro X Superlight 2 PCB can also be swapped out to run mechanical switches.

###### Notes
###### <sup>1</sup> Quality Control issue with main and secondary clicks where it becomes sticky over time. This is due to the rubber and poron dampeners. Simple fix by removing the dampeners but requires new skates and time to disassemble. Otherwise go through the return merchandise authorization (RMA) process.
