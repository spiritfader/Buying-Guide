# Context
In the modern keyboard market, many types of switches exist in keyboards. 

> **_NOTE:_** This guide will mainly focus on the **MX platform** but will mention other popular switches in the market such as:
> - Hall Effect (HE)
> - Electrocapacitive (EC)
> - Membrane


# Criteria
In recommendations, keyboards will be judged on many factors such as:
- Software support
- Build quality
- Price-to-Performance

Other small features will also be noted down such as
- Hot-swappable
- Customisation
- Lubed switches and stabilisers




# Prebuild

Prebuilds are pre-assembled keyboards that will work right out of the box. 

Many newer prebuild boards now offer 2.4ghz wireless and/or Bluetooth compatibility, providing flexibility in how you connect your keyboard.
> **PLEASE NOTE**: This does **NOT** mean that the keyboard cannot be used wired. In fact, most will require a wired connection to charge the battery
