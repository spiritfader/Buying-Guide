# Table of Contents
[Prebuild Keyboard](#prebuild)

# Context
In the modern keyboard market, many types of switches exist in keyboards. 

> **_NOTE:_** This guide will mainly focus on the **MX platform** but will mention other popular switches in the market such as:
> - Hall Effect (HE)
> - Electrocapacitive (EC)
> - Membrane


# Criteria
Please note that keyboards are highly subjective and many will have different experiences. For transparency reasons, recommendations are based on more objective factors such as:
- Software support
- Build quality
- Price-to-Performance
- Consensus and reviews


# Prebuild

Prebuilds are pre-assembled keyboards that will work right out of the box. 

These keyboards are generally cheaper than custom keyboards due to mass production. 

Many newer prebuild boards now offer 2.4ghz wireless and/or Bluetooth compatibility, providing flexibility in how you connect your keyboard.
> **PLEASE NOTE**: This does **NOT** mean that the keyboard cannot be used wired. In fact, most will require a wired connection to charge the battery

# Avoid List
| Category | Brands| Reasons
|--|--|--|
|**Gaming brands** |Razer, Corsair, Steelseries, Logitech, Glorious, Asus etc | - **Expensive Models**: An example is the Razer Blackwidow V4 Pro, retailing at $230 with plastic construction, worse software and internals.<br>- **Poor Construction**: These boards tend to use cheaper material like ABS plastic and stiffer internals which may give an undesirable typing experience <br> - **Local Software**: Brands often make locally saved software for their keyboards such as Razer Synapse which could affect the computer's performance <br> - **Limited customisation**: Boards often lacks customisation such as soldered PCB, irregular keycaps, and untuned stabilisers.
|**Budget Keyboard Brands** | Aula, Akko, Ajazz, Leobog, Royal Kludge, VGN, MageGee, Redragon | - **Reliability:** These boards tend to be unreliable such as some stop working partially/completely and some have even [caught on fire](https://imgur.com/a/royal-kludge-is-good-brand-you-should-buy-keyboards-x7LTFwp). <br>- **Repurposed OEM**: It's not necessarily bad to reuse OEMs but this can explain the trend of unreliable PCBs across other boards, and cloned keyboards where they look oddly similar (KiiBOOM Loop75/Monsgeek M1) <br> - **Software:** Same as gaming brands, mostly locally saved and unstable. These also tend to be in Chinese or other foreign languages which can make them inaccessible for most people.
