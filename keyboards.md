[Prebuild Keyboard](#prebuild)

# Context
In the modern keyboard market, many types of switches exist in keyboards. 

> **_NOTE:_** This guide will mainly focus on the **MX platform** but will mention other popular switches in the market such as:
> - Hall Effect (HE)
> - Electrocapacitive (EC)
> - Membrane


# Criteria
In recommendations, keyboards will be judged on many factors such as:
- Software support
- Build quality
- Price-to-Performance

Other small features will also be noted down such as
- Hot-swappable
- Customisation
- Lubed switches and stabilisers




# Prebuild

Prebuilds are pre-assembled keyboards that will work right out of the box. 

Many newer prebuild boards now offer 2.4ghz wireless and/or Bluetooth compatibility, providing flexibility in how you connect your keyboard.
> **PLEASE NOTE**: This does **NOT** mean that the keyboard cannot be used wired. In fact, most will require a wired connection to charge the battery

> Many issues arise from big-name gaming companies - 
> - Many of their flagship models such as Razer's Blackwidow V4 Pro ($300) are incredibly expensive for what you get.
> - Builds are generally made with cheap materials such as plastic and incredibly stiff mounting styles, which results in an undesirable typing experience
> - Software such as Razer Synapse, and Corsair iCUE are downloaded locally and are cited as bloatware.
> - Lack of customisations - these boards tend to have soldered PCB, irregular keycap size and unlubed switches/stabilisers.
