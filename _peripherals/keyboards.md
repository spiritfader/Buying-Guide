# Recommendations

The following reccomendations are primarily prebuilds, but some custom keyboards kits will be included.

## < ~50$ 

- Lemokey X Series <sup>1</sup> : $20-40 

- Keychron C3 Pro / C3 Pro 8K <sup>1</sup> : $28-55 

- Logitech K120 : $15 

## ~$50-100

- **Shortcut Studio Bridge75 <sup>2</sup> :** $85-120 

- Keychron V Max : ~$100 

- Womier SK75: $100 


## ~$100-150

- Swaykeys Eave65: $50 (KIT: Does not include switches, stabilisers and keycaps. High chance of hitting around 100-150)

- Melgeek Real67 (HE): $120

- Luminkey Luminkey60 Pro: $145 
  
- Melgeek Made68/84 Pro (HE): $150

- KBDFans Tiger Lite Gaming (HE/MX): $85 (KIT: Does not include switches and keycaps. HE includes a Venom TKL HE pcb)

## ~150-200+

- Qwertykeys Neo60 Core / Neo65: $100 (KIT: Does not include switches, and keycaps. High chance of hitting around 150-200+)

- Qwertykeys Evo80: $170
  
- Luminkey Luminkey65/75v2/98: $179-$220 
  
- Keychron Q Max: ~$200
  
- HHKB Professional Classic/Hybrid/Type-S <sup>6</sup> (Topre) ✨
  
- Realforce R3 <sup>3</sup> (Topre) ✨

- Venom 60/TKL HE: $65-70 (PCB: This is a PCB for hall effects, this does not include everything such as plate, switches, keycaps, stabilisers, and case. Please do extensive research before approaching this)

###### <sup>1</sup> Lemokey and Keychron are sister companies, so both of them are pretty much the exact same. These boards tend to go on sale very often.
###### <sup>2</sup> Choose either the standard or plus. Do NOT buy the HE model of this board.
###### <sup>3</sup> Topre is a very niche and small product in the keyboard market. Thus do research on these switches if you are interested.


# Avoid List

| Category | Brands | Reasons |
|:--------|:---------|:-------|
| **Gaming brands**   | Razer, Corsair, Steelseries, Logitech, Glorious, Asus etc  |  **Expensive Models**: An example is the Razer Blackwidow V4 Pro, retailing at $230 with plastic construction, worse software and internals <br><br>  **Poor Construction**: These boards tend to use cheaper material like ABS plastic and stiffer internals which may give an undesirable typing experience   **Local Software**: Brands often make locally saved software for their keyboards such as Razer Synapse which could affect the computer's performance <br><br>  **Limited customisation**: Boards often lacks customisation such as soldered PCB, irregular keycaps, and untuned stabilisers.|
|**Budget Keyboard Brands** | Aula, Akko, Ajazz, Leobog, Royal Kludge, VGN, MageGee, Redragon | **Reliability:** These boards tend to be unreliable such as some stop working partially/completely and some have even [caught on fire](https://imgur.com/a/royal-kludge-is-good-brand-you-should-buy-keyboards-x7LTFwp)  <br><br> **Repurposed OEM**: It's not necessarily bad to reuse OEMs but this can explain the trend of unreliable PCBs across other boards, and cloned keyboards where they look oddly similar (KiiBOOM Loop75/Monsgeek M1)  <br><br> **Software:** Same as gaming brands, mostly locally saved and unstable. These also tend to be in Chinese or other foreign languages which can make them inaccessible for most people.|

# Custom

Custom keyboards are keyboards that you build yourself. If you do not want to tinker with this, stick with prebuilds.

If you are considering a custom keyboard, keep in mind of these factors:
1. **Budget** - I recommend having a minimum budget of **$200** when considering a build. While it's possible to spend less, opting for lower-end components will compromise the overall quality, making a pre-built keyboard a more viable option.
2. **Passion**: If you have an interest in the custom keyboard hobby, consider a custom keyboard
3. **Patience** - Custom keyboards are produced in small batches, meaning a potentially significant wait time. These wait times can range from a few weeks to even years.
4. **Research** - Researching and understanding each component in a keyboard will help you make informed decisions in selecting parts.
