# Resources
* [Eloshapes](https://www.eloshapes.com/)
  - Nice website to look into different mice specifications.
  - Not every mice is in the database.
  - Not the best to rely on as some shapes will look very similar to each other but in reality they are possibly different.
 * [Rting](https://www.rtings.com/mouse)
   - Website that reviews and provide performance data for mice.
   - Certain categories such as their mouse reviews limit you to 10 reviews a day.
   - Not every mice is in their database.
   - Unlike Eloshapes, uses 3D scans instead of 2D outlines.
 * [TechPowerUp](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/?category=Mice&manufacturer=&pp=25&order=date)
   - Also reviews and provide performance data for mice.
   - Not every mice if in their database.
   - No comparison tool for mice shapes.

###### <sup>2</sup> For those who are in a budget and have very limited options due to their local market.
###### <sup>3</sup> Recommend getting the Maya X or Viper V3 Pro if it's available in your market. The shape is very similar but it is built much better. 
###### <sup>4</sup> Not recommended to buy new. Can be bought used for cheap. Units with double clicking can be easily fixed by either soldering new switches or buying a hotswap PCB off aliexpress. G Pro X Superlight 2 PCB can also be swapped out to run mechanical switches.
